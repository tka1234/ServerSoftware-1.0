This program will eventually be able to load a specified server, and then monitor it, send e-mail or text messages of its status, run in eco-mode where the computer shuts down the server and hibernates at set times, be able to come out of eco-mode to perform other maintenance tasks, be able to switch servers on demand, and be remotely controllable. Also I will implement an applet for players to see if the server (and which server) is online at any time, and possibly even see who is playing on it (minecraft only.)

It will eventually be coded with mainly Java, along with possibly C++, Batch, and AutoHotKey Scripts.

Progress Report:
- Loads Servers: No, because of broken code I found online.
- Monitors Servers: No, can't do AHK until I get the server (and screen size).
- Sends Email/Text Notifications: Fully capable but not fully implemented.
- Eco mode fully working: Has some problems detecting half hour times and times close to current.
- Task Scheduler and hibernate/sleep: Not until I get AHK and the Server itself.
- Maintenance Tasks: Not until I get the Server itself.
- Remote Controllable: That's going to be interesting.
- Player Applet: Final thing to do, least priority right now. 
- Make this a knockoff of Steam, with 100% more Hats: #1 Goal
