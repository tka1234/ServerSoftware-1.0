AMDGS-Software
==============

Software to control my new "AMD Gaming-Server" PC.

Mini-Gaming PC / Game Server Specs:
CPU: AMD A6-5400K 3.6GHz Dual-Core Processor
Motherboard: MSI FM2-A75IA-E53 Mini ITX
RAM: Corsair Vengeance 4GB DDR3-1600
HDD: Seagate Barracuda 500GB 7200RPM
Case: Rosewill V3Plus-B Mini ITX Tower Case, 4x NMB 40mm fans + 3.5" Fan Controller
OS: Windows 7 Home Premium 64bit

This program will eventually be able to load a specified server, and then monitor it, send e-mail or text messages of its status, run in eco-mode where the computer shuts down the server and hibernates at set times, be able to come out of eco-mode to perform other maintenance tasks, be able to switch servers on demand, and be remotely controllable. Also I will implement an applet for players to see if the server (and which server) is online at any time, and possibly even see who is playing on it (minecraft only.)

It will eventually be coded with mainly Java, along with possibly C++, Batch, and AutoHotKey Scripts.
